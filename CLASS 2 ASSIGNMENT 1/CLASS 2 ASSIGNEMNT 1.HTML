    <p> Although I was born in <b>Houma Lousiana</b> we moved to north <b>Texas</b> when I was five years old due to my father's new job.
        We lived in Texas, in that same home, for many years. I attended <mark>Baylor University</mark>,then a local community college before deciding to join the Navy in search of adventure the commercials promised. The adventure was certainly found with travels all over the world to include 36 different countries and 2 trips literally "around the world". <del>One thing I never experienced until now is being able to line out a complete sentence. </del>
